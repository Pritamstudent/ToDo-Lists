## 6. Limitations
    - Some of the pages are not responsive ,so they may not load properly in small devices.
    - I tried to authenticate the user by verification link while sign up but it did not work properly.

## 9. Running the Project
- Install XAMPP
- Import database from mytodo_list.sql .
- Run Apache and MySQL in XAMPP. 
- Then open the following webpage in the browser:
    - http://localhost/todolistpritam/index.php

## 10. Summary

option in the list. We also sorted and filtered the tasks in the lists using the Javascript._
